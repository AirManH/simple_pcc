* simple_pcc

A simple point-cloud compression algorithm.

** Introduction

=simple_pcc= implements a
/context-based octree coding algorithm for point cloud geometry/.
This algorithm is based on arithmetic coding, and it uses the
*position in parent node in octree* as context.
Refer to
[[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8451802/][Intra-Frame Context-Based Octree Coding for Point-Cloud Geometry]]
for more details.

The picture below describes the system framework of the algorithm.

** Usage

*** Compress

To *compress* a point cloud file
(for supported file type, see
[[http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/tutorial/geometry/file_io.html#Point-cloud][this page]]
):

#+begin_src bash
python path/to/simple_pcc/cxt_arith_compress.py InputFile OutputFile OutputAuxFile
#+end_src

For example:

#+begin_src bash
python cxt_arith_compress.py bunny.ply bunny.bin bunny.aux
#+end_src

After this, you will get 9 files:

#+begin_example
bunny.aux, bunny.bin.0, bunny.bin.1, ..., bunny.bin.7
#+end_example

*** Decompress

To *decompress*:

#+begin_src bash
python path/to/simple_pcc/cxt_arith_decompress.py InputFile InputAuxFile OutputFile
#+end_src

For example:

#+begin_src bash
python cxt_arith_decompress.py bunny.bin bunny.aux bunny.ply
#+end_src

** Test

Run =pytest path/to/simple_pcc/tests/=.
